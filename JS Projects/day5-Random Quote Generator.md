## 💡 How It Works
- When the user clicks the “Get Quote” button,
- A request is sent to the quote API,
- The response contains a **random quote** and the **author name**,
- That quote is displayed dynamically on the page.

## 🔗 Sample API Used

```bash
https://api.quotable.io/random
```

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "content": "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.",

}
```

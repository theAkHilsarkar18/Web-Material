Absolutely! Let's break down this code and the concepts it demonstrates into a clear and easy-to-understand study guide.

**Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

* **OOP Basics:**
    * OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code around "objects."
    * Objects represent real-world entities or abstract concepts.
    * Key principles include:
        * **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (object).
        * **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.
        * **Classes and Objects:**
            * **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of that type.
            * **Object:** An instance of a class. It's a concrete realization of the class's blueprint.
* **Methods:**
    * Functions defined within a class are called methods.
    * Methods operate on the object's data.

**Code Breakdown**

1.  **Class Definition: `Area`**

    ```javascript
    class Area {
        // ... methods go here ...
    }
    ```

    * This line defines a class named `Area`. The `class` keyword is used to create a new class.
    * Convention: Class names typically start with an uppercase letter.

2.  **Method: `areaOfRectangle`**

    ```javascript
    areaOfRectangle(height, width) {
        document.writeln(height * width);
    }
    ```

    * This is a method within the `Area` class.
    * It calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying `height` and `width`.
    * `document.writeln()` is used to write the result directly into the HTML document.
    * Note that in a modern web enviroment, it is better to avoid document.writeln, and use the DOM to insert content.

3.  **Object Creation**

    ```javascript
    const area = new Area();
    const area2 = new Area();
    ```

    * The `new` keyword is used to create instances (objects) of the `Area` class.
    * `area` and `area2` are now objects of type `Area`.
    * Each object has its own copy of the class's methods.

4.  **Method Invocation**

    ```javascript
    area.areaOfRectangle(10, 20);
    document.writeln("hello");
    area2.areaOfRectangle(30, 10);
    ```

    * `area.areaOfRectangle(10, 20)` calls the `areaOfRectangle` method on the `area` object, passing in 10 and 20 as arguments.
    * The result (200) is written to the document.
    * `document.writeln("hello")` writes the string "hello" to the document.
    * `area2.areaOfRectangle(30, 10)` calls the same method on the `area2` object, with different arguments. The result (300) is also written to the document.

**Key Takeaways**

* Classes are blueprints; objects are created from those blueprints.
* Objects have methods that operate on their data.
* You can create multiple objects from a single class, each with its own state.
* OOP is a powerful way to organize code, especially for complex applications.
* `document.writeln()` is a javascript function that writes directly to the html document.

**Practical Application**

Imagine you're building a geometry application:

* You could create classes like `Circle`, `Triangle`, and `Square`.
* Each class would have methods to calculate its area, perimeter, etc.
* You could create objects of these classes to represent specific shapes.

**Example of improved code**

```javascript
class Area {
  areaOfRectangle(height, width, elementId) {
    const area = height * width;
    document.getElementById(elementId).textContent = `Area: ${area}`;
  }
}

const areaCalculator = new Area();

// Example usage:
areaCalculator.areaOfRectangle(10, 20, "rectangleArea1");
areaCalculator.areaOfRectangle(30, 10, "rectangleArea2");

// html example.
// <div id="rectangleArea1"></div>
// <div id="rectangleArea2"></div>
```

This improved version uses the DOM to update the content of html elements, which is a better practice.
